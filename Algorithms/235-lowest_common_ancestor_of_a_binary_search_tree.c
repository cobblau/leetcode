Description:

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

    According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

            _______6______
           /              \
        ___2__          ___8__
       /      \        /      \
       0      _4       7       9
             /  \
             3   5
     For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
